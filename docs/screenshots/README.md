2. **Clear any test data** - Use realistic player names and scores
3. **Show key features** - Make sure important UI elements are visible
4. **Good lighting** - If showing dark theme, ensure it looks good
5. **Hide sensitive info** - Don't include any personal information
6. **Optimize images** - Compress images to reduce file size while maintaining quality

## Image Optimization

After adding screenshots, consider optimizing them:

```bash
# Using imagemagick (if installed)
convert screenshot.png -resize 1920x1080 -quality 85 screenshot.png

# Or use online tools like:
# - TinyPNG (https://tinypng.com/)
# - Squoosh (https://squoosh.app/)
```

## Updating Screenshots

When the UI changes significantly, remember to update the screenshots to reflect the current state of the application.
